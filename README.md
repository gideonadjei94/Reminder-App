# Reminder App with Flutter and Firebase

This project is a reminder app built using Flutter for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. The app allows users to create, view, update, and delete reminders, and it also provides authentication and authorization features using Firebase Authentication.

## Features
* User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in securely using their email and password, with authentication handled by Firebase Authentication.
* Reminder Management: Users can create, view, update, and delete reminders.
* Real-time Updates: Changes to reminders are reflected in real-time across all users' devices, thanks to Firebase Realtime Database.
* Responsive Design: The app is designed to work on both Android and iOS devices, with responsive layouts for different screen sizes

## Technologies Used
* Flutter: A cross-platform framework for building mobile applications.
* Firebase: A comprehensive platform provided by Google for building mobile and web applications, with services such as Authentication, Realtime Database, and Cloud Firestore.
* Firebase Authentication: Provides easy-to-use authentication services with built-in support for email/password authentication.
* Firebase Realtime Database: A cloud-hosted NoSQL database that syncs data across clients in real-time.
* Firebase Cloud Firestore: A flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development.
